## Welcome to my page
You can know about me, and idiotic friends in this page. 
Whenever they try to commit suicide because of their breakups, I try to help them getting rid of their idiotic intentions instead of killing them my self. Aw geez.. I always wanted to kill them when they bring up topics about their idiotic senselesss love stories.
